                <h1> The Divine Love of Radha and Krishna</h1>
                <p>
                    Radha and Krishna’s love story is one of the most celebrated tales in Hindu mythology. Radha, a cowherdess, and Krishna, a divine incarnation, shared a deep and eternal love. Despite being married to another, Radha’s devotion to Krishna was unparalleled. Their love is often seen as the ultimate union of the soul with the divine.

                <p>
                    One of the most enchanting stories is the Ras Leela, where Krishna performs a divine dance with Radha and the Gopi's (cowherd girls) of Vrindavan. During this dance, Krishna multiplies himself so that each Gopi feels his presence. Radha, however, stands out as the most beloved, and Krishna’s special attention to her signifies her supreme devotion.
